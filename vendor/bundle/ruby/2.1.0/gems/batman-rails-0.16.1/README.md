# Batman::Rails

Easily setup and use batman.js (0.16) with Rails 4

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'batman-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle
    $ rails generate batman:app

### Layout and namespacing

Running `rails generate batman:app` will:

- create the following directory structure under `app/assets/batman/`:
  
  ``` 
      - models/
      - views/
      - controllers/
      - html/
      - lib/
      - app_name.coffee # initial setup & requires
  ```

- create a controller & route to server your batman.js app from `/` and serve HTML 
- configure the asset pipeline to precompile `app_name.coffee`

## Generators

Batman-Rails provides 3 simple generators to help get you started using batman.js with Rails.
The generators will only create client-side code (CoffeeScript).

### Model Generator

    rails generate batman:model

This generator creates a batman model inside `app/assets/batman/models` to be used to talk to the Rails backend.

### Controllers

    rails generate batman:controller

This generator creates a batman controller for the given actions provided.

### Scaffolding

    rails generate batman:scaffold

This generator creates a controller, helper and model to create a simple crud single page app

## Usage

Created a new Rails application called `blog`.

    rails new blog

Edit your Gemfile and add

    gem 'batman-rails'

Install the gem and generate scaffolding.

    bundle install
    rails generate batman:app
    rails generate scaffold Post title:string content:string
    rake db:migrate
    rails generate batman:scaffold Post title:string content:string

You now have installed the `batman-rails` gem, setup a default directory structure for your frontend batman code. Then you generated the usual Rails server side scaffolding and finally generated Batman.js code to provide a simple single page app.

## Precompiling Views

In production, you may want to send all your HTML templates with the first request rather than sending them as-needed. `batman-rails` includes a view helper to do this. Add it to your application layout:

```erb
    <%= batman_define_views %>
```

It will gather HTML from `app/assets/batman/html` and interpolate them into JS code to preload `Batman.View.store`. If your HTML is in another directory, pass that directory as an option:

```erb
  <%= batman_define_views(path_to_html: "app/assets/templates/">
```

Now it will gather HTML from `app/assets/templates`!
